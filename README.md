# calculator

I used static double and static string to declare the varriable that will be used for user to type in. After adding all the buttons, textfield, and radio button, I declared the action which allows them to work for the code that I typed in. First, for all the buttons that allows user to type in numbers, I used If statement, and in the if statemennt, I used get text and set text for it to read the vvalue and print it on the jTextField1 which is the display screen. For the operator, I decalered the seperate value "static String operator" to used in different types of operator. I also used if statement, set text, and get text for it to work. After making these button, I have two left which are equal and delete button. For the equal and delete button, I also used if statment. For equal, I used else if ladder to show what user had put on the textfield and than find the operator to see what operator should caluculator choose. Finally for the back space button, I declared length and another value that initialize length-1 which will delete one value at a time if i press it. That is it for the explnation of my simple calculator.
